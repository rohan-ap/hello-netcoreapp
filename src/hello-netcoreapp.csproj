         net451 for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Some NuGet packages don't target these anymore, so you might need to remove this target when using those NuGet packages.
         Note: The app can't be built for net451 and net461 on non-Windows machines, so take that into account in the build scripts. -->
